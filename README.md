# Surfs Up!
Module 9 Challenge - Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

*Project Overview*:

In this challenge, we were asked to write a Python script to work on advanced data storage and retrieval. The goal of this project was to extract and store weather data so that we could perform basic central tendency analysis on the data to meet our client's needs. The client is looking to open up a surfing/ice cream store and wants to be sure that the store is located ideally in terms of temperature and precipitation to maximize the surfing/ice cream profits. 

*Resources*:

Code and Software: Python, Numpy, SQLalchemy, Jupyter Notebook, and Anaconda

## *Results*

### *Three major differences between the two months:* 

- June is 5% warmer than December, with an average temperature of about 75 degrees Farenheit. While the temperature difference isn't huge, our client should expect more sales on warmer days, so June should be a more profitable month for the surf/ice cream shop.  
- The temperature is slightly more variable as well in December, which could lead to bigger swings in temperature, affecting the profits of our store. 
- The minimum temperature is much higher in June, by nearly 8 degrees Farenheight (+14%), which means that the store could be opened earlier in the day than in December to maximize profitablity while reducing payroll costs for a given year. 

### *High level overview and two additional queries:*

Generally, the month of June should be more profitable for the surf/ice cream parlor. Minimum temperatures are much higher in June than in December, and we should expect more foot traffic earlier in the day and later into the evening due to warmer temperatures. 

Two additional queries: 
- I would suggest querying information on sunrise and sunset times, which should help optimize store opening/closing hours based on month. I would expect that there will be significantly more hours of sunlight in June than in December, which might necessitate different hours of operation and staffing. 
- Additionally, a query involving tidal charts (low and high tide) would be really helpful to dial in stafffing related to the "surf" portion of the concept. It would be useful to know when to expect the best wave conditions month-to-month to allow for additional or reduced surf staffing, as the case may be.
